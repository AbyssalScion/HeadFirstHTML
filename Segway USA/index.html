        Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way: Walla Walla, WA,
        Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, CO, Why, AZ and Truth or Consequence, NM.

        I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: 
        <blockquote> 
            Passing cars,<br>
            When you cant see,<br>
            May get you,<br>
            A glimpse,<br>
            Of eternity.<br>
        </blockquote> 
        I definately won't be passing any cars :)

        My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because i'm on a
        Segway, i won't be able to bring a whole bunch lot with me: cell phone, iPod, digital camera and a protein bar.
        Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single
        step...Segway.</q>
